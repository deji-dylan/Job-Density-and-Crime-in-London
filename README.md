# Job Density and Crime in London

## Overview
This project explores the correlation between job density and crime rates across London boroughs. By leveraging statistical and spatial analysis, it aims to provide insights for policymakers and urban planners to develop strategies that balance economic growth with public safety.

## Background
Urban planning and crime prevention are closely related, and both are influenced by the spatial distribution of jobs. Understanding how job density impacts crime rates can lead to better-informed urban policies. This study examines various theories, including social disorganization theory and economic opportunity perspectives, to analyze how job concentration affects crime patterns.

## Data Sources
The analysis in this notebook is based on:
- **Crime data:** Crime statistics for different London boroughs.
- **Employment data:** Job density statistics from official government sources.
- **Geospatial data:** Borough boundaries and spatial distributions for mapping.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Gather crime, job density, and spatial data.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and structuring data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying trends and correlations.
4. **Statistical Analysis:** Using regression models to assess the relationship between job density and crime rates.
5. **Visualization:** Mapping spatial distributions and presenting key findings.

## Requirements
To run the analysis, install the necessary Python libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn geopandas folium
```

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deji-dylan/Job-Density-and-Crime-in-London.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Job Density and Crime in London.ipynb"
   ```
3. Run the notebook step by step to explore the analysis.

## Key Findings
- Areas with higher job density tend to have varying crime patterns, with certain types of crime increasing or decreasing based on job concentration.
- Statistical models suggest a potential correlation, though other factors (such as socioeconomic status and policing) may also play significant roles.
- Geospatial analysis highlights boroughs where job density and crime rates are most correlated.

## Future Work
- Expanding the analysis to include additional factors such as income levels and housing density.
- Incorporating time-series analysis to study trends over different years.
- Applying machine learning techniques to predict crime rates based on job density and other urban features.
